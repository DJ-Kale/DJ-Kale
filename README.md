- 👋 Hi, I’m @DJ-Kale aka Kyle
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming more efficient with Programming and adopting new languages to eventually start a career in Programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. Actively dabbling in whatever else seems interesting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I guess, but my skills might not be too useful until I learn a bit more!
- 📫 How to reach me - khumphreytech@proton.me
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/They/Them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like running. My typical runs range from 3-6 miles, and I *try* to run 3 times a week at a minimum.
